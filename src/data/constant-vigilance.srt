1
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:09,250
Well, you know you're a survivor because you're there

2
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:18,000
Well obviously my contemporaries who committed these atrocities are dreadful

3
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,233
but I'm concerned that...

4
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:27,233
sometimes think what I would have been if I hadn't been Jewish

5
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,433
Would I have been a Nazi?

6
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,267
And I probably would

7
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,717
You know, it's very difficult for a 12, 13, 14 year-old

8
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,417
to resist the temptations the Nazis offered for kids of that age

9
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:25,017
Uniforms, campfires, learning to shoot rifles

10
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:29,117
Things like that as they had in the Hitler Youth

11
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:34,883
And, it's very very difficult for a kid of that age to resist that temptation

12
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,917
And not be part of the crowd
