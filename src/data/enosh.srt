1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,999
Unknown: No. See ya.

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,109
When people
gradually started to

3
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,669
learn that I was
researching Jewish

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,469
music, a lot of
people said oh, you

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:17,939
must speak to Rudy
lever.

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:33,869
No. When I first met
Rudy, which was at

7
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,849
the Bradford
synagogue, I asked

8
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:39,539
him what his story
was, as it were, he

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,659
talked about his
youth, and then the

10
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,939
Nazi occupation,
etc. And how he come

11
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,839
to England. And he
talked a little bit

12
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,569
about how he'd been
a singer in the

13
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,999
synagogue, most of
his life, eventually

14
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,369
became the Kanto the
Brentwood synagogue.

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,909
He played violin, as
a child, but had

16
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,549
never had any kind
of formal

17
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,009
theoretical,
university level

18
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,619
type of education in
music. In fact, he

19
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,449
was a dentist, very
good dentist, I

20
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:16,979
believe. But he's
kept that music

21
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,859
going. And then in
the nine in the 70s,

22
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,099
he composed Enosh
not I don't know if

23
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:27,989
it was exactly out
of the blue, but it

24
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,309
seems to be out of
the blue

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,710
he told me about
this in a very

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,650
matter of fact, way.
Oh, yeah. And then

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,130
in the 70s I, I
composed this opera,

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,590
as he called it. Not
quite accurate, but

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,470
that doesn't matter.
I composed his opera

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,600
called Enosh. What's
that today it's a

31
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,060
it's a thing for
chorus and full

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,570
orchestra solos.
Background

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:22,110
training. Content

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,620
Rudy was very
musically

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,650
knowledgeable, from
a sort of very

36
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,430
advanced amateur
level. He knew his

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,200
opera very well. He
was an admirer of

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,070
Bach, and Mozart,
Beethoven, all

39
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,750
sorts of class
either played the

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,480
piano, Chopin,
Schubert, Beethoven,

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,640
and my mother sang
as a

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,200
child or his father
had some LPs, I

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,630
think, that they
listened to, I think

44
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,960
one of them was the
Berlioz enfants

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,650
DocList, which
remained a very dear

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,990
piece to him
throughout his life

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,420
and was performed in
the same concept as

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,120
well an extract from
it was was performed

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,240
in same concert as
Enosh. And so he had

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,280
he was steeped in a
sort of Western

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,680
classical music
tradition, as well

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,850
as a synagogue music
tradition, some of

53
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,960
which is very
similar to that

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
western classical
tradition, but some

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,340
of it some of which
is not. And it's

56
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,730
very almost Islamic
in nature, or

57
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,760
Arabic, certainly,
in its influences.

58
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,060
And so what I think
he was trying to

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,380
achieve was to to
meld the meld his

60
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,830
his knowledge of
classical music with

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,540
that synagogue
tradition.

62
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,849
Now see ya

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,010
it's like an
oratoria

64
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:31,079
Really it's it's can
you? Kid.

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,120
Rudy, didn't just
leave the tunes as

66
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,820
they were. He sort
of intervened

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,130
musically, he
changed aspects of

68
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,130
some of the what we
might call hymns,

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,020
synagogue. The
classic one is Enosh

70
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,860
mankind, which is
sung on Yom Kippur

71
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,400
war. It's very
serious. It's sort

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,330
of the end of a long
process of praying

73
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,570
and singing towards
the end of a fast.

74
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,780
It's very well known
in the Jewish world.

75
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,980
But he changed
aspects of harmony

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,020
sort of played
around with the

77
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,950
rhythm a little bit.
You'll hear it start

78
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,480
and you'll think,
Oh, yes, that's in

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,290
our show. And then
you'll hear

80
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,120
something a bit
different. And

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,370
you'll think, Oh,
that's not quite

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,740
what I remember. And
it makes you think

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,050
more about the music
rather than just

84
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,590
hearing a familiar
tune. What he was

85
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,170
trying to do is to
is to sort of feed

86
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,530
into a tradition, or
two traditions, the

87
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,540
duration, that
Western classical

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,660
music, but to
disrupt it a little

89
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,640
bit and draw our
attention to certain

90
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,350
things. And the
soloists music is in

91
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,280
a much more modern
idiom. It's

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,540
beautifully written
actually.

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,520
Men and women they,

94
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,340
the story is of the
Jewish people,

95
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,980
essentially, it
starts with the

96
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,380
people of Israel,
being happy to have

97
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,690
arrived in the
Promised Land. And

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,770
then it becomes
gradually more

99
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,850
serious as they're
overtaken by various

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,300
events throughout
history. Whilst it's

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,940
never upfront,
explicitly

102
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,570
expressed, you can
identify particular

103
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,640
historical things,
and eventually

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,130
coming to the
Holocaust. And

105
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,770
there's a moment
where there's

106
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,590
obvious references
to Hitler without

107
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,400
naming him and to
the horrors that

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
were perpetrated
upon the Jewish

109
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,650
people. And then
after that, there is

110
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,510
a short epilogue, I
guess, whereby there

111
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,820
is a sort of sign of
hope for the future,

112
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,550
I would say a
qualified hope, not

113
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,860
A, not an a sort of
an ecstatic,

114
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,860
uncontrolled hope.
But there is a sort

115
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,540
of root space for
reflection and

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,160
optimism.

117
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,630
It's off my mouth,
and the meditation

118
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,570
is acceptable.

119
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,650
He left Germany
quite early on in

120
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,710
his childhood, and
he left before the

121
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,780
worst of the
atrocities

122
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,620
otherwise, one might
assume, sadly, that

123
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,480
he wouldn't have
survived. So thank

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,700
God, he did leave.
So he never spoke to

125
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,050
me about that
individually, but I

126
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,300
knew the the
history, more or

127
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,840
less.

128
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,190
We went by train,
ship, train, and

129
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,550
then train. I liked
travelling, the

130
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,120
excitement,

131
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,280
I think, whilst
again, he never

132
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,510
articulated it
precisely. I think

133
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,590
that that was quite
a powerful personal,

134
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,140
I wouldn't say
reconciliation with

135
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,710
but engagement with
an expression of

136
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:53,010
that trauma that
survivors suffer. I

137
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,860
think certainly the
the power of the

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,120
music that he wrote,
that comes from

139
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,820
somewhere. I think
he was working

140
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,070
through a number of
historical emotional

141
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,170
aspects

142
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,800
from Hamburg to brim
a half and we had

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
the compartment to
ourselves. Then the

144
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,840
customs officer came
around, he asked my

145
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,730
father to go to
another compartment.

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
We stopped at a
station. When we set

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,230
off I said, Where's
daddy? My mother was

148
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,080
just as frightened.
But she said, he'll

149
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,650
be along. They had
asked him questions

150
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,060
and body searched
him. He

151
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,400
did talk about his,
his escape, for want

152
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,010
of a better word,
the music and the

153
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,410
narrative in the
text works through

154
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
some of that idea of
escape, and finding

155
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,210
a better life
somewhere. And then,

156
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,230
the risk of it all
happening again, and

157
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,070
eventual partial
catharsis. So

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,020
there was a tender
to take us on the

159
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,720
ship to the key
side. We went to the

160
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,630
station. It seemed
very dark. It was

161
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,390
November. So it got
dark early. It was

162
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,700
raining, there were
gas lights, and the

163
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,510
train puffed a lot
of steam. That was

164
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,480
our entry to
England. And the new

165
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,500
and better life.

166
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,160
One could tell when
he felt something

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,890
very deeply. He's
very sincere man.

168
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,020
Very gentle man. I
would say. My, one

169
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,040
of my main impulses
behind doing it was

170
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,320
yes, there's a self
interest in terms of

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,690
the research and the
the potential

172
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,390
academic outcomes
and things like

173
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,460
that. But actually,
the most important

174
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,800
thing for me was to
do it to get it done

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,150
for Rudy. Because he
kept saying to me,

176
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,730
I'm on a limited
timescale here. He

177
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,660
knew that he
