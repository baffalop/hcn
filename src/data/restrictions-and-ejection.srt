00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,129
So, at this time, in various countries

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,057
People realised that awful things were happening in Germany

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,500
And they lobbied governments and they said,

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,443
"We know you have a severe unemployment problem..."

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,714
"We know you don't want to add to it by bringing a lot of refugees into the country..."

6
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:26,129
"But will you save some of the children?"

7
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:33,514
And so some countries, including Britain, said yes

8
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:39,114
And they organised what was called the Kindertransport
