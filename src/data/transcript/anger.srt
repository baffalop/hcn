00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,279
Val Ginsburg: Now I must point out that

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,050
whenever and wherever the Nazis occupied the country,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:16,200
they made a special point of indoctrinating the population

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,690
spreading all sorts of vicious rumours

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,430
presenting the Jews as Communists, Bolsheviks,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
they were presented as vermin to be exterminated.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,940
And it seemed to work.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:41,070
In fact 80% of the German killing machine

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,350
- of the Holocaust killing machine was non-German.

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,470
They knew that hunger is demoralising.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,680
It reduces people to animal level.

12
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,080
And that's what they wanted to do.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,670
They wanted to dehumanise us, to demoralise us

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,950
and to isolate us completely from the non-Jewish population.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
And then they could do away with us.

16
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:46,540
They told us to wear yellow Stars of David front and back,

17
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,470
to brand us as different from all the other people.

18
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,910
Iby Knill: I personally found that very  - I got very angry about it.

19
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,820
Because I couldn't see why I should be any different to anybody else

20
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,690
Because none of my friends were wearing yellow stars

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,830
And I thought I would put them into an awkward situation,

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,450
if I stayed in friendships or relationships with them.

23
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,490
We were also taught that on public transport, we weren't allowed to sit down.

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,630
In shops we were the last ones to be served. And I just decided

25
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,650
that I wasn't going to use public transport under those circumstances.

26
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,940
I would rather walk to school and use a scarf to cover my yellow star.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,120
So I seemed to spend most of my time queuing up in shops to get food

28
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,280
Because the rule was that people with yellow stars

29
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,920
should be the last ones to be served in shops.

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,830
So quite often by the time it became your turn,

31
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,130
there was hardly anything in the food shops nearby.

32
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,820
Also, our business had been what they called aryanised,

33
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,880
that the state took it over and put a non-Jewish person in charge

34
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,690
Although my parents had still to continue to work there.
