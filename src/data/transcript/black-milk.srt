1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,550
I had a mother who when I was born

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,920
she had just, you know, escaped from undescribable trauma,

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,070
lived in the face of death and the dying.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,770
It's unimaginable, what she was really exposed to.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,010
I'm sure, in her books and in her writings and in her lectures,

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,070
she's not, I don't think she's even scraped the surface,

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,180
or dared to scrape the surface,

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,920
or been able to scrape the surface

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,780
of what she really had to endure.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,450
Well, when I was younger, when I was a child,

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,340
she taught me how to spin the wool.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,870
This fresh wool from farmers in like, Scotland or something.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,580
We would sit together in the living room,

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,430
and she'd teach me how to, like, clean the wool and prepare it

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,910
and spin it, and then show me stuff she was making with it.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,020
She made, like, cardigans.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,940
I think she made a cardigan for me at some point

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,230
that I had when I was little.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,350
Because I still knit and crochet and stuff all the time,

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,640
and I always think of her when I do that.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,580
We know psychologically that if you allow that degree of trauma

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,550
to go under the– you know, to penetrate,

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
you die, you don't survive.

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,710
And so in some way you have to protect– you have to lock it out.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm a psychologist, and I work with these– It's not surprising

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,470
that I work with these kind of things myself.

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,450
It's interesting, I can't remember the statistic,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,350
75 or 80% of second generation survivors

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,490
work in the health services as psychologists or doctors or therapists,

30
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,700
you know, and why is that? It's interesting, isn't it?

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,180
And that's been my salvation really,

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,340
understanding it myself as a phenomenon,

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,740
and this enabled me to a large extent,

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,270
to in a way, heal.

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,680
Heal, yeah.

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,640
I read some parts of the first book, but for me, honestly,

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,760
the way the transgenerational trauma works for me is

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,510
I get quite uncomfortable reading about

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,460
anything that has to do with war in general.

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,760
It's like I get a trauma response that it's not from my own life,

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,490
in response to any sort of stories about things like that,

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,430
or her story, like, I can't physically process it.

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,580
All the survivor wants to do is to protect their kids,

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,060
of course, but you can't do that.

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,260
You know, you think you can do that,

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,100
but you can't do that.

47
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,310
And they do it either by becoming extremely devout,

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,670
loyal to the Jewish faith, or rejecting it completely,

49
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,930
pretending it wasn't there,

50
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,940
and kind of that's what my mother did

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,380
for a large part of her life.

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,780
When I get into this, it moves–

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,490
my feelings get very sort of,

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,970
it opens up something very powerful in me,

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,500
because it's been such an emotionally powerful journey.

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
She thought she'd protected me.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,020
She thought that I was free, that it hasn't been transferred,

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,630
you know? But it's really been a huge

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,340
 piece of work for me for 20 years or so, and is continuing in a way.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,860
She talked about it later in her life, obviously, about

61
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,990
what she'd been through when she wrote her books and everything.

62
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,480
But she was very emotionally detached from it,

63
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,080
which I think is something she had to do to cope with the trauma, obviously.

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
I can't imagine.

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,840
So I never talked to her personally about it.

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,140
When you grew up as a young child or as a baby

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,270
with someone that has just, in a way, escaped or

68
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,030
come out of multiple traumas over several years,

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,620
you're going to be living with someone who

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,400
has very explicit post traumatic stress symptoms,

71
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,670
which you know at that time nobody knew anything about it,

72
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,520
but it means you know emotional distance,

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,050
not being in contact with your feelings,

74
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,580
not being able to have empathy,

75
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,810
not because you're not empathetic,

76
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,420
but because, you know, your traumas are so severe

77
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,790
that you have enough surviving and managing from day to day.

78
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,000
and you put a lid on your emotions to be able to survive from day to day.

79
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,870
And you just imagine everything we know today

80
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,630
about child development, the important emotional presence,

81
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,640
the importance of emotional presence,

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,300
what that will do to that child, in terms of feeling, you know,

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,360
not seen or understood, or feeling lonely or fearful.

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,100
There's something very dangerous out there.

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,120
You know, there's nowhere to go.

86
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,940
There's no haven, there's no safe haven, secure base.

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,920
There's a French poet, Paul Celan.

88
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,700
He wrote, he was a Holocaust survivor himself.

89
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,090
And he talked about, he intuitively understood these things

90
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,010
when he wrote a poem called Black Milk.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,040
Black breast milk and it passes something on

92
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,340
but what is passed on, the child has nothing to hang it on to.

93
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,580
There's no hooks to hang there to understand it.

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,260
But I'm very, very fortunate that being able to

95
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,020
use my life to understand these things and help other people.

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,980
I bear no resentment, no bitterness, no–

97
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,030
just, I feel just love, and I did for the last few years with my mother.

98
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,120
But it could easily be- I've experienced many of my clients

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,740
who are very glad when their parents die.

100
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,280
They just have never felt understood or met.

101
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,330
Because our parents, they can never understand us,

102
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,510
because, if they understand us, they have to understand themselves

103
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,670
and open up the spaces within themselves

104
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,250
which are just so threatening to access.

105
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,180
You can't go there, and that's very understandable,

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,740
Very understandable.

107
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,690
But these books and everything she wrote was all part and parcel.

108
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,590
This need to show that she was worth,

109
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,690
worthy of being in the world.

110
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,930
Having to prove her worth all the time in one way or another.

111
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,020
And that was a very strong driving force for her.

112
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,280
Because you're the evidence of the fact that life goes on,

113
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,110
that the Nazis didn't succeed, right?

114
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm the evidence.

115
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,130
And I have to shine and go out there.

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,700
That's the that's the absolute message you're getting

117
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,830
as a child of a second generation.

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,810
You get out there and shine and show the world

119
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,560
that Hitler didn't succeed.

120
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,510
What gives me meaning and a feeling of relevance

121
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,080
is to be there for others. And I don't mean that that wasn't–

122
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,800
that was also so for my mother, but as a therapist, I am really using

123
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,600
this knowledge that I'm sharing in therapy room,

124
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,250
and I really can see and witness the extent to which this really

125
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,140
can support and help people understand themselves

126
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,220
and heal themselves, because it gives me a perspective very,

127
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,050
very few people have on life, and I'm very, very grateful for that.

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,570
Because it's so rewarding to be allowed to do that.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,910
She's very– she was very brave.

130
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,330
She's like she's the most powerful woman I think I ever met in my life,

131
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,650
because she went through so much, and she persisted through it,

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,550
and she pushed even farther and achieved so many things.

133
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,130
To me, she's just like a symbol of like:

134
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,820
Don't give up, just keep pushing forward and do your best.

135
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,880
And she went far. She got places.

136
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,360
That's the only way I can sum it up, I think.

137
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,080
So maybe that's the point of my life.

138
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,140
Maybe that's why I am who I am, doing what I do.

139
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,210
Is that I'm going to somehow or another

140
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,610
– without having too big ideas about myself –

141
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,070
you know, I'm in a position to be able to try to,

142
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,520
in a way, resolve, to a certain extent, family traumas.

143
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,250
But to be able to embrace your life

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,200
and honour your life whilst you're still alive.

145
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,360
I think that's such an important thing to be able to do,

146
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,010
for better or for worse.

147
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,180
And forgive yourself, yeah.

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,970
It takes a lot of courage to take on, you know,

149
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,650
the consequences of your actions.

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,570
For better or for worse, you know?

151
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,570
And, yeah, you know, she's taught me a lot

152
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,420
and I'm deeply grateful for this.

153
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,170
I'm deeply grateful for having had the mother I had,

154
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,670
and having to have her work through these things,

155
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,620
because when I– my whole ability and capacity

156
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,110
as a therapist is dependent on that understanding

157
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,870
that I've been forced to embrace.

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,050
Which is incredibly challenging to acquire.

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,470
I think it's quite phenomenal what I've achieved, because

160
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,980
I could have taken my own life when I was 45, round about there.

161
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,230
I could have just ended it all, because

162
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,630
the whole thing seemed so insurmountable.

163
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,320
Since I was little, since I was born,

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,240
I've been a very strong willed person.

165
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,030
And I think that definitely comes from her,

166
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,360
because we were very similar in many ways.

167
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,670
Also very different in very many other ways.

168
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,570
But the thing that I saw in her, a lot, that I also saw in myself,

169
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,400
was that it's almost like stubbornness, but it's in a good way.

170
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,640
It's like, instead of being stubborn and annoying,

171
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,840
it's more just like, stubborn in the way that I refuse to give up

172
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,330
 on things, like I refuse to just fall down and then give up.

173
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,710
Because I've been through a lot of ups and downs in my life,

174
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,810
and there's many points that if I wasn't the strong willed person that I am,

175
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,290
I would have given up and I wouldn't be here.

176
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,620
And I think that's really something that she gave to me.

177
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,840
My main focus of attention right now is my own death.

178
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,570
I'm working with embracing my own mortality and–

179
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,600
but just to be able to embrace death as something

180
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,320
that I can embrace with gratitude, as a natural

181
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,310
and normal conclusion of a life that's lived to the full.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,610
Which is what I would have wished for my mother.

183
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,780
So maybe, if I can do that, I can somehow, in a way, heal her.

184
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,040
Yeah, in a way, within me. We carry our parents within us.

185
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,910
You know, certainly.
