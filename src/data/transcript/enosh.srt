1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:02,910
Enosh

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,210
When people gradually started to learn that I was researching Jewish music

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,730
A lot of people said: 'Oh, you must speak to Rudi Leavor.'

4
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,130
When I first met Rudi, which was at the Bradford synagogue,

5
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,880
I asked him what his story was, as it were.

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,840
He talked about his youth, and then the Nazi occupation, etc.

7
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,380
And how he'd come to England. And he talked a little bit about

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,980
how he'd been a singer in the synagogue, most of his life,

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,370
eventually became the Kantor the Bradford synagogue.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,610
He played violin, as a child,

11
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,660
but had never had any kind of formal theoretical,

12
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,660
university level type of education in music.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,780
In fact, he was a dentist, very good dentist, I believe.

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,860
But he kept that music going. And then in the nine- in the 70s,

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,840
He composed Enosh.

16
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,720
Not- I don't know if it was exactly out of the blue,

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,310
but it seems to be out of the blue.

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,180
He told me about this in a very matter of fact, way.

19
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,240
'Oh, yeah. And then in the 70s I,'

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,940
'I composed this opera' as he called it.

21
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,190
Not quite accurate, but that doesn't matter.

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,310
I composed his opera called Enosh.

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,730
I said: 'Oh yeah, what's that?'

24
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,370
And he said: 'Oh it's a it's a thing for chorus and full orchestra solos.

25
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,360
[inaudible] 

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,300
Rudy was very musically knowledgeable,

27
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,020
from a sort of very advanced amateur level.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,040
He knew his opera very well.

29
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,820
He was an admirer of Bach, and Mozart, Beethoven,

30
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,200
you know the sorts of classic- 

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,470
My father played the piano, Chopin, Schubert, Beethoven,

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,130
and my mother sang

33
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,590
As a child or his father had some LPs, I think,

34
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,300
that they listened to, I think one of them was

35
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,750
the Berlioz Lâ€™enfance du Christ,

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,970
which remained a very dear piece to him throughout his life

37
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,400
and was performed in the same concept as-

38
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,870
well an extract from it was was performed in same concert as Enosh.

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,670
And so, he was steeped in a sort of Western classical music tradition,

40
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,990
as well as a synagogue music tradition,

41
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,440
some of which is very similar to that western classical tradition,

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,660
but some of it some of which is not.

43
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,770
And it's very almost Islamic in nature, or Arabic, certainly, in its influences.

44
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,880
And so what I think he was trying to achieve was to meld

45
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,550
his knowledge of classical music with that synagogue tradition.

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,920
Enosh

47
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,300
It's like an oratoria, really.

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,710
Rudi, didn't just leave the tunes as they were.

49
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,900
He sort of intervened musically, he changed aspects of some of the

50
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,650
what we might call hymns, in the synagogue.

51
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,060
The classic one is Enosh 'Mankind'

52
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,040
which is sung on Yom Kippur. It's very serious.

53
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,090
It's sort of the end of a long process of

54
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,560
praying and singing towards the end of a fast.

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
It's very well known in the Jewish world.

56
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,000
But he changed aspects of harmony,

57
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,880
 sort of played around with the rhythm a little bit.

58
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,680
You'll hear it start and you'll think 'Oh, yes that's Enosh.'

59
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,750
And then you'll hear something a bit different.

60
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,410
And you'll think 'Oh, that's not quite what I remember.'

61
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,380
And it makes you think more about the music

62
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,150
rather than just hearing a familiar tune.

63
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,180
What he was trying to do is to is to sort of feed into a tradition,

64
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,160
or two traditions, the Jewish and the Western classical music.

65
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,170
But to disrupt it a little bit and draw our attention to certain things.

66
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,410
And the soloists music is in a much more modern idiom.

67
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,560
It's beautifully written actually.

68
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,270
The story is of the Jewish people, essentially.

69
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,080
It starts with the people of Israel, being happy

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,850
to have arrived in the Promised Land.

71
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,670
And then it becomes gradually more serious

72
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,710
as they're overtaken by various events throughout history.

73
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,720
Whilst it's never upfront, explicitly expressed,

74
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,530
you can identify particular historical things,

75
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,930
and eventually coming to the Holocaust.

76
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,140
And there's a moment where there's obvious references to Hitler

77
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,400
without naming him and to the horrors that

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,260
were perpetrated upon the Jewish people.

79
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,500
And then after that, there is a short epilogue, I guess

80
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,820
whereby there is a sort of sign of hope for the future,

81
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,730
I would say a qualified hope, not a

82
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,660
not an a sort of an ecstatic, uncontrolled hope.

83
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:44,160
But there is a sort of root space for reflection and optimism.

84
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,310
He left Germany quite early on in his childhood.

85
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,410
And he left before the worst of the atrocities otherwise,

86
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,700
one might assume, sadly, that he wouldn't have survived.

87
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,350
So thank God, he did leave.

88
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,810
So he never spoke to me about that individually,

89
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,840
but I knew the history, more or less.

90
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,030
We went by train, ship, train, and then train.

91
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
I liked travelling, the excitement,

92
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,400
I think, whilst again, he never articulated it precisely.

93
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,280
I think that that was quite a powerful

94
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,140
personal, I wouldn't say reconciliation with,

95
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:52,050
but engagement with an expression of that trauma that survivors suffer.

96
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,920
I think certainly the power of the music that he wrote,

97
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,690
that comes from somewhere.

98
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,290
I think he was working through a number

99
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,170
of historical, emotional aspects

100
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,490
From Hamburg to Bremer Hafen we had the compartment to ourselves.

101
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,310
Then the customs officer came around,

102
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,740
he asked my father to go to another compartment.

103
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,700
We stopped at a station. When we set off I said:

104
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,990
'Where's daddy?'

105
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,660
My mother was just as frightened. But she said: 'He'll be along.'

106
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,680
They had asked him questions and body searched him.

107
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,390
He did talk about his, his escape,

108
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,250
for want of a better word, the music and the narrative in the text

109
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,180
works through some of that idea of escape,

110
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,210
and finding a better life somewhere.

111
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,190
And then, the risk of it all happening again,

112
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,180
and eventual partial catharsis.

113
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,320
So there was a tender to take us on the ship to the quay side.

114
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,430
We went to the station. It seemed very dark.

115
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,260
It was November. So it got dark early.

116
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,080
It was raining, there were gas lights,

117
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,330
and the train puffed a lot of steam.

118
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,990
That was our entry to England.

119
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,510
And the new and better life.

120
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,950
One could tell when he felt something very deeply.

121
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,420
He's very sincere man. A very gentle man.

122
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,020
I would say. One of my main impulses behind doing it was

123
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,020
Yes, there's a self interest in terms of the research

124
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,670
and the potential academic outcomes and things like that.

125
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,520
But actually, the most important thing for me was to do it,

126
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,500
 to get it done for Rudi.

127
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,230
Because he kept saying to me, I'm on a limited timescale here.

128
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,400
He knew that he wouldn't be surviving another 20 years or something

129
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,650
and that it needed to be done there and then.

130
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,860
And so, within the kind of confines of what I could do,

131
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,820
I wanted to do it for him primarily.
