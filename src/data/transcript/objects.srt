1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,950
Towards the end of January 1940,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,220
I was put on a boat to come to England.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,280
Been traveling on my own,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,480
since I was four really, all through the war,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,240
all through the air raids and everything.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,990
I had a teddy bear - a Steiff,

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,750
which came with me from Germany.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,220
But when I was in my teens,

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,240
they quote unquote 'cousins' decided

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,890
that I was too old for a teddy bear,

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,780
and buried it in their garden.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,250
The only toy I brought with me from Germany.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,600
I had favorite possessions that I couldn't possibly take.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Some years earlier, I had been taken for a walk

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,920
by my mother. And we passed a shop

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,990
where there were some round things.

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,940
I must have been about five years,

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,530
possibly six years old.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,930
And it was explained to me that the world is round.

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,670
And these were globes.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,540
Giving a map of the world as it actually is.

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,920
So I wanted one.

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,910
So we went into the shop and asked how much they cost.

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,750
And that put an end to it that I wasn't going to get one.

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,880
Some months later, one of my uncles,

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,170
he came to Leipzig on business, he stayed with us.

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,720
And of course the world imposes

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,330
certain obligations on visiting uncles.

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,610
I got my globe

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,220
and it became one of my favorite possessions

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,490
and I studied it and I knew the geography of the world.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,960
I knew where all the principal countries were.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,760
But of course I couldn't possibly take it.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,850
I got an atlas eventually, but not a globe.

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,490
I was very sorry to lose that globe.

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,010
Of course it would be out of date today.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,170
The little suitcase that she brought on her journey is here.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,740
And inside it I've got some of the things

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,560
that I know came across in 1939.

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,380
Schoolbooks - I've got some of them here.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,100
I brought back any that she'd kind of written copiously in.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,090
Because I find the most moving thing is handwriting.

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,560
The hardest thing to part with

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,890
- for me me anyway is anything with handwriting.

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,790
And I've got every book that my mother had her name written on.

45
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,640
One book that I don't have, because I couldn't find it.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,860
But I know it existed at one stage

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,450
and she must have got rid of it

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,120
was one book that had the name 'Sarah' in

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
All Jewish women were forced to

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,540
add the name 'Sarah' to their names.

51
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,380
And my mother had written in one of her books:

52
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,600
Ursula Henrietta Barbara Sarah Michel

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,990
That's a real piece of history and I don't have it.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,870
Every single object in this cupboard has a history.

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,250
This comes from Bratislava.

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,370
And she's got a partner.

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,660
These are Slovakian.

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,850
So are these: that's a škola or školka - 'školka' means 'school'

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,960
My cousin Tony. He lives in Geneva.

60
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,120
Or just outside Geneva.

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,040
Has found a collection of books in the Prague Museum,

62
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,630
which belonged to Hugo Friedman.

63
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,390
And he's in the process of trying to recover them.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,470
And this says 'pekár' and that's a 'baker'.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,210
The Wiener Library had a huge collection of books

66
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,370
that belonged to Hugo Friedman.

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,810
And these some or other have turned up

68
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,880
in the Prague Museum whether they are part

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
of the same collection -

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
(voices blending)

71
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,740
But these are my treasures.

72
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,110
You see, I don't have gold.

73
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,310
I don't have silver.

74
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,500
I was born on the eighth of September 1934.

75
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:00,070
And I was the middle of three as was by 1936.

76
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,030
We've all got very English, British sounding names.

77
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,550
My older brother was Robert.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm Thomas, and I prefer Tom, but there we go.

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,250
My younger brother, William

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,440
and he preferred being called Bill.

81
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,240
Whether it was something or someone out there

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,500
that said to my parents

83
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,770
'You should give your children English sounding names, I don't know.'

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,460
But they had another son who was born in 1930.

85
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,770
And he died 1932. And he's buried in the Brünn, Jewish cemetery.

86
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,810
And his name was Michael.

87
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,130
So my parents gave each of their children a middle name,

88
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,810
beginning with the letter M.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,460
So, Bob was Robert Milton, I'm Thomas Montague,

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,160
and Bill was William Mortimer.

91
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,740
So, something somewhere must have said to my parents:

92
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,410
You're going to be in a different environment later on in your lives.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,560
These are Tom's toys, his childhood things.

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,150
When he came here in the thirties as a little boy

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,910
and actually I've just noticed that this is a suitcase

96
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,040
And it says 'Granny' on it, which is very sweet -

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,480
- there was a letter in this.

98
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,070
The letter from the palace was

99
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,370
because they sent a belt each to the two princesses

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,530
as a thank you for letting them come to England.

101
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,380
So these are part of his car and petrol stations,

102
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,080
Six? No. Six by the time - six or seven.

103
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,600
And these are the toys that we played with.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,100
In many ways it seems like a typical - (paper rustling)

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,390
A little boy did it because

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,770
And this is a - I think like a cowboy belt? A holster.

107
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,800
And there is a gun and there's a tin helmet.

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,520
I only keep everything because my parents kept everything.

109
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,830
She looks to have gingerish hair, but I don't know that that's true.

110
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,080
This may be an artistic impression.

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,410
But it's my aunt Hilda and I've no idea what age she is.

112
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,770
But she looks early 20s.

113
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Very formally dressed, going to a party.

114
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,110
Going for a good night out I guess.

115
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,590
But I only wish that the document on the back of it hadn't faded.

116
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,940
And these photographs, these are all - and postcards

117
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,230
- all related to the Kubies.

118
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,200
And we've got hundreds and hundreds of their photographs

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,340
Pre-war Jewish lives.

120
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,780
So Kubies and Friedman's.

121
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,240
I really liked them, because it's just them on their holidays

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,370
and special days out. They love skiing.

123
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,220
They spent a lot of time in health resorts.

124
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,410
So yeah, they're going all over like Hungary

126
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,262
and Italy and Czech Republic and -

125
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:10,290
- like a baby, and clearly a baby was born

127
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,820
and they took lots of photographs of them.

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,580
And then they're just even more mundane things

129
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,210
with people hanging out there washing or like sitting in the car.

130
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,320
And with pets. Yeah, I like that this is very

131
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,940
'every day' this collection.

132
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,850
That's me! Standing on a sort of balustrade

133
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,130
by aunt's villa my... one of my mother’s sisters.

134
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,790
She was a widow and she had this wonderful villa.

135
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,470
You went up the steps, then there was a sort of mosaic floor.

136
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,070
That's me, being taken for a walk by the Danube.

137
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm wearing leggings, beautifully knitted leggings-

138
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,440
This actually got the history behind it.

139
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,720
In 1938, when the Germans went into Austria,

140
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,900
my father was anxious.

141
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,650
And so were other people, so we ended up at his mother's

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,670
place in Vrbové.

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,450
And here we are all going for a walk

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,140
in this little country village and we're playing silly beggars. We just chased our hats.

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,260
It's photographs and it's when they are - they are creased.

146
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,300
They've been folded in half and a quarter and-

147
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,310
- father sitting on a horse.

148
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,130
That's from World War One

149
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,010
-is it folded up, because they had to put it discreetly

150
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,830
on their person? Or has it been- yeah

151
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,080
It was put in someone's wallet? Perhaps in their pocket.

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,130
Or did they hide it?

153
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,070
Letters from father should be somewhere in here

154
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,520
yes that’s to do with father...

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,930
As there were three of us and we all lived in different places.

156
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,650
Father would write a letter - one a week

157
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,500
to a different one of the three of us.

158
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,290
And then we will then pass our letters round.

159
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,860
So, in the end, we all had a letter once a week.

160
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,680
It's one of the last letters, because the last letter

161
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,810
was on my birthday. It arrived in time for my birthday.

162
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,920
It's somewhere in there.

163
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,090
He wrote very nice letters.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,540
He was a good dad.

165
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,520
I can see him in my mind's eye sitting in this-

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,810
- one little room, with one chair and a bed

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,920
and the tiny table and teaching himself English.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,580
He wanted - yes, he wanted to - that was his aim -

169
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,520
Two weeks after that he was taken away and dead.

170
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,570
My letter started 'Dear Mr and Mrs Alfsen'

171
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,930
'Are you the people who looked after a little,

172
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,120
four year old girl in 1940? 1939-1940?

173
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,070
If so, I'm that little girl.

174
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,850
And it was through my boss at the university

175
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,930
that I found them.

176
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,120
He gave me the address. And then he says:

177
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,050
'Right, it's up to you.'

178
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,120
And that's when I went back into my office.

179
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,670
And I wrote this very, very long letter.

180
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,970
And then a week later, I got a letter back saying that

181
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,940
they were the family that looked after me,

182
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,260
and when am I coming?

183
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,140
So the next thing was to book a passage to go to Norway.

184
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,830
When my mother came, she went to one family

185
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,400
for a fortnight, and then the sort of first

186
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,670
and as it happened, final foster family.

187
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,710
She remembered being the one who had to

188
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,140
tell my mother that the war had started.

189
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,100
And this is the telegram that they received

190
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,990
announcing my mother's arrival.

191
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,110
And she kept- I mean, she was about a hundred and-

192
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,260
a hundred and three when she died.

193
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,760
And she kept that telegram from 1939.

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,470
As we get further away from living survivors

195
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,190
that can actually tell us how it happened.

196
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,450
We are relying only on objects that remain.

197
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,990
But we still need a tangible link

198
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,730
to the individuals that owned them.

199
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,480
A little antiseptic powder.

200
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,140
A writing case in which she did actually keep all her mother's-

201
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,790
- a very nice perfume bottle.

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
a little leather sewing - her school pencil case.

203
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,490
Her initials in varying sizes, large and then small.

204
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,330
There are two lists, one of what was destroyed on Kristallnacht.

208
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,200
Her signet ring and a locket with her maiden initials on,

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,500
are nowhere to be found.
