1
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,470
At this time in various countries,

2
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,070
people realised that awful things were happening in Germany

3
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,830
And they lobbied governments and they said:

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,220
'We know you have a severe unemployment problem.'

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
Which pretty much all countries had.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,850
'We know you don't want to add to it,

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,910
by bringing a lot of refugees into the country.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,250
But will you save some of the children?'

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,120
And so in some countries, including Britain, said: yes.

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,780
And they organised what is called the Kindertransport.

11
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,100
'Jews,' said Hitler, unalterably seek to undermine

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,150
German's fertility, military strength, and purity

13
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,590
in order to make them too weak to cast Jews off and out.

14
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,320
Thus, Jews were behind prostitution and venereal disease,

15
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,510
delusional notions like international law and human rights

16
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,250
and soft hearted ideas about the equality and brotherhood of people.

17
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,190
Like Nietzsche, Hitler thought Jews had introduced

18
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,490
the debilitating language of morality, ethics,

19
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,490
compassion, and empathy into the world.

20
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,460
Logically then, the Jew must be contained

21
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,550
and ultimately removed from the German sphere.

22
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,200
If Germany is to succeed in the struggle for living space

23
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,110
- Lebensraum, and survival.

24
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,480
Their idea of conscience was, he insisted

25
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,760
choosing his simile deliberately,

26
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,150
a blemish, like circumcision.

27
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,510
A supposedly unnatural alteration

28
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,430
of how human beings are created.

29
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,180
Hitler therefore promised in Mein Kampf

30
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,870
To rollback emancipation and drive Jews out

31
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,060
into their own world or abroad.

32
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,420
By expelling them first from German political life,

33
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,440
then from the nation's cultural life, and finally,

34
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,940
from its economic life.

35
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,730
The party platform, the 25 point programme of 1920,

36
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,040
for instance, contained Point Four:

37
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,870
Calling for the denial of citizenship to Jews and their descendants

38
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,240
Point Five: Demanding their classification as resident aliens.

39
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,680
Point Six: excluding them from public office.

40
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,060
Point Eight: Blocking further immigration by Jews

41
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,880
and expelling all, who had entered the country

42
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,590
since the beginning of World War I.

43
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,760
The other atrocity took place in 1944.

44
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,510
And that was the so called Children's Action.

45
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,320
In our ghetto, they had a number of children.

46
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,380
And they were our darlings. They were well looked after,

47
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,260
despite the hunger and the conditions.

48
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,540
I mean, for us, they were the symbol of our future.

49
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,870
We knew the Nazis are determined to exterminate

50
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,260
every single Jew in their power.

51
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,840
Orders came from Germany, that anybody

52
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,490
who was not employed, gainfully by work

53
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,850
should be eliminated.

54
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,090
On the 18th of March,

55
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,870
a detachment of SS and Ukrainian militia

56
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,110
marched into the ghetto, and they removed forcibly

57
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,520
all the children, all the disabled, all the sick people,

58
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,740
all the old people, anybody who couldn't, wasn't fit for work.

59
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,180
They were killed the next day.
