1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,080
I remember visiting my aunties,

2
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,420
my uncles,

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,740
my grandma.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,840
And the smells.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,020
You know they're the most important things in my life the smells.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,360
Certain tastes that you remember.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,510
So that's what I remember from my childhood.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,800
Before - you know before things got black and nasty.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,120
Those are the happy times.

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,380
What do you miss most?

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,970
Who did you leave behind?

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,580
How do you feel about yourself now?

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,990
Is it quiet inside?

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,580
Or do you always remember their voices?

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,380
So what do you remember most?

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,970
Everybody had to sort of turn their radios off.

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,490
You couldn't listen to the radio anymore

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,340
and everybody had to 'shush shush'.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,070
If they were talking about- everybody had to whisper.

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,390
My mother pushed me under the bed.

22
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,930
And she started to pace

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,960
up and down past the bed.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,500
And I was under the bed so I could see.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,230
There was a little rug where she was pacing,

26
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,520
but she was pacing further.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,090
And I started to see hair on this rug.

28
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,370
She was tearing her hair out.

29
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,640
I thought: 'What's happening? What's that?'

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,950
Anyway, sooner than later, we heard big footsteps coming up

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,140
the wooden stairs, the nice apartments.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,370
And I heard a lot of heavy wooden steps.

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,630
You know? They- they sound funny on wood.

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,760
Just not the same as on carpet or stone.

35
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,950
And they were heavy.

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,560
They came knocking on the door

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,470
and we didn't answer. They knocked again, banging.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,650
And we heard the door being broken with an axe.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,210
You know, the lock and the doors,

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,790
just bashed in with an axe.

41
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,520
And French police among Gestapo came in.

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,540
A Gestapo is a special SS man.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,980
He's an SS man really.

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,110
He represents the man who gave the orders.

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,410
And the man who gave the orders came from the top is Hitler.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,300
And the next one is Eichmann.

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,760
Eichmann was the man who put all his signature

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,060
to all of these arrests in Paris. Eichmann.

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,620
Who do you think of the most?

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,670
What was your favorite memory?

51
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,280
Do you miss her?

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,520
Do you miss him?

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,190
Do you miss them?

54
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,630
We had to go at night very furtively Madame Colombe and me.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,470
 And she took me to say goodbye to my grandparents

56
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,630
just before they were arrested.

57
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,390
And I said goodbye to my grandparents.

58
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,120
She left me there for about, I don't know, an hour.

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,710
Because we lived, literally across the road, literally.

60
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,310
And I remember sort of asking - my grandfather,

61
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,360
he was a traditional old Polish gentleman

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,650
and he had his little - I had only little I call it a yarmulke.

63
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,480
But people call it something else.

64
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,010
I can't remember the name now the English name,

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,120
but it's a ££

66
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,540
And he had a very long white beard.

67
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,800
Long and then you know, all these hair and this white hair.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,610
I remember snuggling into my grandfather and smelling him.

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
And smelling his beard.

70
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,420
It had - It's really strange

71
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,830
because when a child has a sense of smell, it's sharp.

72
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,760
It hasn't been spoiled by anything like smoking

73
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,720
or the things to get in the way so you can smell

74
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,600
Everything. And you could - it was sort of

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,090
it wasn't a dirty smell, he'd washed it - I just -

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,630
 I can still smell him. He smelled of age and food.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:22,500
What does it feel like, to be the one still alive?

78
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,970
And sometimes when I was younger,

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,380
I had this terrible what they call now survivor guilt.

80
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,080
I lived with that till I was way, way, way, way way in my 40s.

81
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,860
The survivor guilt. The same question that goes in your mind.

82
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,560
In your nightmares, day and night, day and night:

83
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,310
Why did they take me and leave my parents behind?

84
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,110
Why was I left behind?

85
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,050
To live a, you know, a sole life

86
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,600
without anybody around me that I knew.

87
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,420
Why, you know, had this cruel thing happened.

88
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,320
And I didn't want to be, I didn't want to be.

89
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,660
Because I just felt it was too cruel.

90
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,460
I didn't actually understand.

91
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,820
I couldn't override the fact that I was very lucky.

92
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,130
I couldn't see that part.

93
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,460
I could only see it at a later time. But at that time,

94
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,660
I think the survivor guilt overrides everything else

95
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,240
and the happiness always is below the surface.

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:08:05,190
So all you see is layer of survivor guilt and no happiness.
