1
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,560
I no longer have any reason to speak Slovak

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,060
I haven't done so for the last 80 odd years

3
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,930
and the very few words in my head.

4
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:12,300
...of pageants. And I can remember standing on the little stage

5
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,140
in the village hall in '?' with-

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,550
Sokol was this physical exercise movement.

7
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,750
1000s of us belonged. And the song I sang

8
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,410
was the song we used to sing as children

9
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,920
when we were going into the exercise class.

10
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,660
I couldn't tell you clearly what it was. But I did sing one.

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,360
And now I can't remember it.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Underneath Kriváň and Kriváň is one of the highest mountains in the Tatras.

13
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,850
If my geography still holds out. I never went to the Tatras.

14
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,600
And there's a good reason for that. A) I don't think my father

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,730
would ever afford a - a skiing holiday day for the family.

16
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,720
And I went to a Jewish school and every winter,

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,290
our playground was turned into an ice rink.

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,770
So we went skating and mother was a keen swimmer

19
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,990
and we swam in the Danube.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,360
Before the late 1920s, the Danube used to freeze over

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,210
and people used to skate on the Danube.

22
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,360
And I even brought my shoes with the skates screwed in,

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,740
with me to England.

24
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,560
I haven't got them anymore, because I don't skate anymore.

25
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,780
It used to hang in our dining room come whatever it was,

26
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,130
it hung above our grand piano.

27
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,610
This room was between the room, which was our general room

28
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,840
in the flat and that general room contained-

29
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,690
we had a posh dining room, which also included our grand piano

30
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,300
with Judith hanging over the grand piano.

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,670
And we also had our cupboard cabinet,

32
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,270
which had our clothes in it.

33
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,100
And as well as that, my father had a very large desk,

34
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,510
with a telephone which was very unusual in those days.

35
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,440
And that was the desk at which he would do his writing.

36
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,410
And father and mother had twin beds pushed together

37
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,820
And the divan across the beds,

38
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,790
because Father used to have a nap after lunch,

39
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,610
because midday was when you had your main meal.

40
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,690
I very clearly remember the painting, because I was petrified of it.

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,650
And if I woke up and I was a bit afraid, I wanted to go in mother's bed,

42
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,970
I had to go through here.

43
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,530
With a grand piano there and she hung up on this side of the grand piano

44
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,320
And she used to terrify me.

45
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,470
There she is. There's Judith with a blooming head behind her skirt.

46
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,970
My sister and I learned piano, my brother learned violin.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,770
Mother played the piano.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,300
And father was very interested in opera and music.

49
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,670
So there was music in the house.

50
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,550
My brother used to make little crystal sets,

51
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,870
which we had a little thing,

52
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,610
you used to put your little pin in, and it would then make crackling noises.

53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,210
And we used to listen eventually, to Mr. Hitler shouting.

54
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,880
And I remember that very distinctly.

55
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,090
Radios, I suppose were quite novel things in those days.

56
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,590
And father used to go into that room to listen to broadcasts.

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,760
And I can remember broadcasts of Hitler,

58
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,000
because he used to always shout when he was speaking.

59
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,140
I can't remember the contents because I think as a young child,

60
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,590
it wasn't of interest to me. We had a communal room

61
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,170
in which my brother sister and I slept.

62
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,220
We had our dining table, and father had his large desk.

63
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,510
And we had a telephone on the desk. So that was it.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,830
There. The next door, we had this other in between room

65
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,740
where we had a grand piano and we had this fantastic painting

66
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,890
of Judith and Helofernes.

67
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,840
It used to frighten me a bit.

68
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,180
So I - my father was a banker -

69
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,200
I think most of the memory is just that it was there

70
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,500
above the piano. And that was all.

71
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,550
And that picture now hangs in my daughter's house,

72
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,730
because I haven't got room for picture, which is 4.6 ft by 4ft.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,030
 It was only after the war, when I started doing research on it,

74
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,840
but it was hidden during the war.

75
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:44,580
And eventually, through my eldest cousin, Igot to find out

76
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,140
that it had been hidden by, at my grandmother's farm,

77
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,180
by some peasants or something.

78
00:06:51,810 --> 00:07:00,030
And it ended up in my uncle's house, after he had returned from Russia,

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,210
with the Czechoslovak army contingent,

80
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,390
which was within the Russian army at the time,

81
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,550
and he was a doctor, and it ended up in his house.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,980
And then in the 1990s, after my uncle had died,

83
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,300
my sister and I went to where my uncle lived.

84
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,090
And it was called Senec. And we told his second wife

85
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,830
because his first wife had been murdered in Auschwitz with his daughter.

86
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:44,050
And this other lady had no idea that this painting actually belonged to

87
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,310
my side of the family and not to her.

88
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,010
So she was quite amenable for us to retrieve it.

89
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,100
And we brought it over to England.

90
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,050
My sister didn't want to have this large painting.

91
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,850
But there were two other paintings two some very much smaller ones.

92
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,460
And she was going to have one and my brother could have had the other.

93
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,600
But my brother didn't want any of things.

94
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,700
He didn't want anything to do with the Holocaust anymore at that stage.

95
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,130
Can you see her, I can't see her anymore?

96
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,960
Oh, well come up a bit further then.

97
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,360
Yes, let me just see if I can see her.

98
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,810
I can see her clearly enough.

99
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,540
Now I can see her better

100
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,720
And be able to see her better still.

101
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,670
Yes, I can see her now.

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,060
Hello, Judith. Haven't seen you for a bit.

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,550
I think it was painted in the 18th century for Ludwig the II

104
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,520
Or Ludwig the mad or whatever he was called.

105
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,620
And it's 4ft6 by 4ft. 

106
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:18,300
It's got a beautiful frame. But Judith herself has fantastic little plaits,

107
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,090
a beautiful gown and a bejewelled sword,

108
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,070
which she's holding in her left hand and with her right hand,

109
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,860
Just behind her skirt, you can see the head of Holofernes.

110
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,840
It is sort of tastefully hidden, but obviously,

111
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,900
She has cut off his head and killed him.

112
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,030
And there she is standing, looking straight ahead of herself

113
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,910
When the picture came, because it's so large,

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,770
she didn't really have any room for it.

115
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,490
So she said would I like it in my house.

116
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,630
So I was very happy to have whatever came really,

117
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,800
because it's just about the only heirloom that we've got.

118
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,630
It's very striking. Whenever we had anyone coming into our house

119
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,030
for the first time, they would always notice the picture.

120
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,710
And we would always have a conversation about the story behind it

121
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,820
And where it had come from.

122
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,040
So it's now in the stairwell on the third floor of our townhouse.

123
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,610
It was really quite difficult to get up there,

124
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,190
one of my sons stood on the bannister.

125
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,480
It's sort of trying to manoeuvre this very heavy, large picture.

126
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,710
So I've no idea how we'll ever get it down again, really?

127
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,490
I see it every day when I come up and downstairs from my bedroom.

128
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,770
But yes, it's sort of part of my life, now, I suppose.

129
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,820
It's you know, the one very large, concrete thing

130
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,450
that has come from my mother's home. 

131
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,070
So yes, it's got place, close to my heart, really.

132
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,340
It's the only thing really, that's come.

133
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,720
And is it very coincidental that I'm called Judith?

134
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,560
It's a guilt frame. And it's plaster work.

135
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,760
Decorated with flowers and bunches of grapes and leaves and things

136
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,260
They are quite intricate, but it's been quite damaged.

137
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,650
And to get it restored the frame and the picture

138
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,050
It would have been very expensive.

139
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,020
But we were also advised that actually that might

140
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,720
change the nature of it, so we decided that we would leave it as it is.

141
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:59,050
And I think it's more evocative, really, that it is damaged.

142
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,730
I think it just shows us a lot of history to the painting,

143
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,060
not just about the painting when it was painted,

144
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,740
but the the life of the painting, that it's travelled.

145
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,730
You know, hundreds of miles.

146
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,110
It's been in hiding.

147
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,820
I think it just adds to the story of the painting.

148
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,390
So I like it as it is
