1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,940
Hier wohnte -

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,180
Hier wohnte -

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,840
- deportiert.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,210
- deportiert.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,790
- ermordert.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,440
They're made out of brass and

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,650
they they always start off with:

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,570
'Hier wohnte' 

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,190
'Hier lebte'

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,960
or sometimes 'hier arbeitete'

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,730
'here worked' and then,

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,700
the name of the person, their year of birth.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,960
And after that as much information as is known

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,350
about their eventual fate.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,360
Sometimes there is a notation

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,070
that the person committed suicide

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,240
and they're kind of quite affecting

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,370
the way it's phrased sometimes it's sort of:

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,580
'Selbstmord', but I read one that said:

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,380
'Fled into death.'

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,520
It's an another way to learn history.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,910
It's an open book and you're reading:

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,880
They killed 6 million Jews.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
That's abstract.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,350
But when the students just around the corner,

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,450
in their neighbourhood,

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,470
they can imagine and that idea they can read:

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,860
'Paul, he was so old as me.'

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
When he was deported.

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,400
I think that's another way to learn history.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,470
In the old part of Cologne, the South part,

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,850
old women came and said to me:

33
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,150
Well, it's pretty good what you're doing here

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,200
But here in our area, never lived gypsy people

35
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,230
and she really don't know.

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,130
And it was ther same with the Jewish population.

37
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,770
They were totally, well, neighbours

38
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,560
And that was at least idea to bring back some names in front of the houses where it started

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,050
where other people were at their home

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,950
and then were called out

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,840
and were deported.

42
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,560
And bring back the names, that was -

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,000
Then I had a contact to the rabbi of Cologne

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,190
and he told me, I don't know where it is in the Talmud.

45
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,340
But a man is forgotten when his name is forgotten.

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,220
That was idea to bring back the names. 

47
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:38,770
Alfred Levy, Jahrgang 1881. Deportiert 1940 Gürs. 1942 - Ermordet.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,920
They were cousins.

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,150
One of my great grandmother.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,650
Older members of my family.

51
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,260
They were old men at the time,

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,550
who lived in a small town

53
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,800
on the Southern German Weinstraße,

54
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,600
and they were very, very much loved

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,100
members of the community

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,400
and very sadly missed when they were deported.

57
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,230
And there are still a handful of people alive today

58
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,940
who were children in the 1930s

59
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,620
who have very, very fond memories of these two old men.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,690
...von Alfred Levy and seinem Bruder Gustav.

61
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,200
erzählte die heute 84-Jährige.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,840
Oft machte sie einen Abstecher zur Wohnung der Levys,

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,260
Alfred, the younger brother by 10 years,

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,950
was very well known in Klingenmünster, their hometown.

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,240
He worked as a travelling salesman of

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,020
farming and domestic equipment.

67
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
and also ran a shop.

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,100
The brothers lived together.

69
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,860
They had a housekeeper

70
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,250
until it was forbidden by law

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,770
for Gentiles to work for Jewish families.

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,050
And then she had to stop looking after them.

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,400
He was very, very popular.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,590
The children absolutely loved him.

75
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,610
He allowed them to run riot in their house,

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,290
play games with them,

77
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,270
fed them sweets and biscuits,

78
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,180
allowed them to ride on his horse.

79
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,240
They were much more innocent times.

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,480
Tripping the memory, or tripping the thoughts.

81
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,800
Sometimes people asked me:

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,670
'You can make it in the Fabrik, by machine.'

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,010
But then I say:

84
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,690
'Auschwitz was a fabric - for death.'

85
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,360
So, every stone is made by hand, individually.

86
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,410
I think it's very important.

87
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,480
When I started, for me as an artist,

88
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,520
it was conceptual art.

89
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,200
In the way, I'd never had the idea to realise.

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,380
But what then a priest in Cologne,

91
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,380
a Protestant priest, who told me:

92
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,470
'Well Gunter, you will never reach the million,

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,410
but you can start small.'

94
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,910
Well now, it's I think, next year to go to:

95
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:09,200
100,000 stones. In 29 countries in Europe.

96
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,720
Maybe 30 countries.

97
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,390
And that's idea:

98
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,720
to bring the stones to every country in Europe

99
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,720
where the Deutsche Wehrmacht, the SS, the Gestapo

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,920
deported people, killed people and with terror.

101
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,620
That there as a symbol, be these stones.

102
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,070
And that will go on and on.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,940
And for this I made a foundation,

104
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,030
that it can go on, because well I'm born in '47, so.

105
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,590
But I think it will. It is for the future.

106
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,900
And especially young people are really, very interested.

107
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,850
How could this happened in the so called

108
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,530
Land der Dichter und Denker. Germany.

109
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,130
And at least, never have it happen again.

110
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,930
Hier wohnte -

111
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,930
Hier wohnte - 

112
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,830
Deportiert.

113
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,860
Deportiert.

114
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,810
Ermordert.
