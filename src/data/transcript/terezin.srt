[Shoshanah speaking in German]

2
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:37,320
Dearest, this is the third time I'm writing directly to you

3
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,770
without ever having received any acknowledgement.

4
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,790
I can only repeat what I write in all these cards,

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,540
that I'm thinking of you with constant longing

6
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,790
and unchanged affection.

7
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,880
And that my heart has a great wish and hope

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,370
To be reunited with you one day.

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,130
...postcards that I was researching through

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,650
the Holocaust Centre in Huddersfield.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,080
They mostly are written by Hugo Friedman,

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,860
who was a businessman in Vienna.

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,370
And some of them were written by his wife, Hildegard.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,170
And they are to what we think was a-

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,840
She was actually a qualified nurse, Irma Doll.

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
And she lived in Vienna also, but we think she did some

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,090
possibly nannying work for Hugo and Hildegard.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,190
Because they had two children.

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,490
They eventually got deported.

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,580
They all died in the Holocaust.

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:47,610
So, the postcards were sent to Irma Doll from Terezin.

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,330
[Shoshanah speaking in German.]

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:18,480
Ich umarme und küsse dich wie eh und je. Dein, Hugo.

24
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,380
The style of writing people have said is quite affectionate

25
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,870
And quite optimistic as well, which is interesting.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,650
It doesn't seem to contain doom and gloom.

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,460
Having said that, whilst there's no particular evidence

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,970
of Hugo's postcards being censored, each postcard,

29
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,740
from every prisoner were checked, so that there was

30
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,280
no overt messages in there of, you know,

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,750
what the conditions were like.

32
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,290
It's interesting to see [inaudible]

33
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,360
the concerns they have for people.

34
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,380
So they're talking very little about themselves

35
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,180
Other than the daily routine and

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,410
And quite often inquiring about other people that they knew

37
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,440
in Vienna or that other family members or...

38
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,600
I've always been curious about the typed element of communications

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,300
from concentration camps, because there is some interest

40
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,370
in whether there is any coding in there.

41
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,580
And if you look at the postcards, there are quite often

42
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,600
what you'd class as a typewriter errors.

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,200
So one letter comes out as bold or

44
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,750
slightly different to the other letters.

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,290
And there's two or three examples of that

46
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,120
across different postcards.

47
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,180
Now, not exclusive to Hugo,

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,460
but generally across communications

49
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,640
from concentration camps and holding camps.

50
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,390
Whether there is some coded messaging in there

51
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,450
by putting those letters together

52
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,860
and obviously in their language,

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,770
seeing if there's any sort of - [inaudible]

54
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:21,240
It seems credible, that at some point,

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,900
somebody would have tried to

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
communicate certain details through this,

57
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,000
this writing, communication.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,290
Because I can only sort of say from my own psyche,

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,070
I think I would definitely try to put, you know,

60
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,790
some sort of message out there that would hint

61
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,290
at what was actually happening,

62
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,710
especially with somewhere, for instance,

63
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,270
like Terezin that was used as a propaganda machine.

64
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,060
And of course, the people in Terezin

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,880
would be aware that that was being staged.

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,010
But I think the drive to actually, well, counter that

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,520
would be too tempting for people who are

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,370
going to be able to sit down and actually think:

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
How can I do this? How can I get-

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,020
even if it's just one sentence: out.

71
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,380
Then you know it's got to be worth a try.

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,510
[Shoshanah reading German]

73
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,140
Excerpt from the Nazi propaganda film about Theresienstadt.

74
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,570
So the library excerpt begins with a shot outside

75
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,030
And there's a signposting to the library

76
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,760
And then it cuts to someone entering

77
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,500
the glass door of the library.

78
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,080
We see the library desk and the staff there.

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,010
There's a lady.

80
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,830
And then there's men conversing, holding books. 

81
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,570
It all seems very professional.

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,970
We see straight into the library with

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,410
many, many stacks of books.

84
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,850
There must be hundreds of them.

85
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,100
It all seems very professional.

86
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,610
And there are men reading books in the library,

87
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,580
conversing over books, we see, what we think,

88
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,160
is Hugo Friedman in a suit and bow tie.

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
And he sits down at a desk.

90
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,680
Everyone is smartly dressed in suits with jackets.

91
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,650
And also wearing the Star of David badges.

92
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,840
When they arrived at Terezin,

93
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,230
they were allowing us a number of suitcases,

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,160
and he'd filled his suitcase with books,

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I think much to his wife's delight, you know,

96
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,700
rather than provisions and clothes,

97
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,940
and possibly medicines and things like that.

98
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,230
He'd actually brought books.

99
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,440
The postcards were sent to

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,350
number 16 Malzgasse in Vienna.

101
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,300
That is actually a synagogue.

102
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,470
Irma Doll's home address was Bauernmarkt 21.

103
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,930
Rather than sending them to her home address,

104
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,750
Hugo and Hildegard was sending them to a synagogue.

105
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,170
A 16 minute walk from Irma's

106
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,690
Bauernmarkt 21 address.

107
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,640
One of the interesting parts of

108
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,860
compiling an object biography

109
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,870
is looking at the geography almost,

110
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,260
of people involved around objects.

111
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,900
The: is it practical

112
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,600
and sensible that this Irma Doll

113
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,210
that I've located at this address

114
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,650
would have visited these addresses?

115
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,270
So she would have left her house,

116
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,600
but where I believe her house would have stood,

117
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,610
there's some billboards up at the moment

118
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,070
and it looks to have been some development work.

119
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,350
And then she would have turned right

120
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,480
down on to Fleischmarkt.

121
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,780
And then she would have turned

122
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,600
onto Rotenturmstraße

123
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,850
and she would have more or less walked then,

124
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,640
in a straight line across

125
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,510
the river there, which would have brought her

126
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,260
onto the other side,

127
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,810
where she would have continued on to Marienbrücke,

128
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,050
and then she would have turned left on to

129
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,400
Obere Donaustraße.

130
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,730
She would have only walked 220 metres

131
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,350
and then turned right on to Friedrich-Wilhelm -

132
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,510
She would have ended up in Leopoldgasse

133
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,140
which is quite a Jewish area, it was then

134
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,690
and I believe it still is now.

135
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,540
She's heading more towards the direction

136
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,370
of where the Friedman's lived -

137
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,620
The intended location would have been,

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,980
at this stage, the synagogue on Malzgasse.

139
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,740
The synagogue was destroyed

140
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,570
as part of the Kristallnacht

141
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,570
But there's also quite near there now,

142
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,010
quite interestingly, there's a

143
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,230
a Sigmund Freud Museum as well

144
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,740
So then she would have got to the Synagogue

145
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,690
There. Now that's where she would have been

146
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,380
collecting the letters from Hugo and his family.

147
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,840
It became a synagogue in 1906.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,230
It was destroyed in 1938.

149
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,060
And then it was used for the infirm and elderly

150
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,530
from 1939 until 1942.

151
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,280
Because that might be Irma's association

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,380
with this particular building,

153
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,210
other than the Jewish synagogue.

154
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,720
Because she was a nurse.

155
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,660
In June of 1942, it became one of the four

156
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,630
Jewish assembly points in Vienna,

157
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,420
in preparation for their deportation.

158
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,540
So that whole journey would have taken

159
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,230
about 16 minutes from her home,

160
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,910
across to the synagogue.

161
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,740
She could then continue on to the Friedmann's house,

162
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,070
Obviously, when they were still resident there

163
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,900
before they were deported.

164
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,880
This this journey was particularly interesting to me,

165
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,690
because I wanted to be reassured

166
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,910
that I was looking at the right person.

167
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,210
To me to actually do at this stage

168
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,830
a Street View walk from Irma Doll's home address

169
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,580
to the synagogue, and then a little bit further

170
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,870
to Hugo's house in Vienna is quite fascinating.

171
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,940
Because I'm seeing what they saw,

172
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,950
to some extent I know the landscapes

173
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,710
and buildings have changed.

174
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,940
But not so drastically that you can't be actually stood

175
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,780
on the same pavement or leant against the same wall

176
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,570
or looking at the same windows,

177
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,680
you know, touching the same door.
