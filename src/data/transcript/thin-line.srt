1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,690
It was just layers of information that arrived

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,640
 seemingly effortlessly.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,190
When I was very little, she told me funny little tales about the watchman's dog

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,660
or about what- how they had to cope with going to the toilet when they were in hiding.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,790
And they didn't actually talk about

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,140
the much more difficult elements of the story until later,

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,090
but they were drip fed and bed,

8
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,540
and because they spoke about it among themselves a lot.

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,860
It also wasn't about me being told it was just about listening

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,480
to the talk around the table,

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,850
because they spoke about it all the time,

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,340
which is very rare in survivors' families.

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,920
In a way, it was the most exciting thing that ever happened to them.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,510
And so it was such a huge thing in their life

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,300
They talked about the biggest thing that my mom was 17,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,420
such a formative experience.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,760
and it was - it formulated the way they saw the world -

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,400
It defined them as people in different ways.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,120
It was always the underpinning- narrative

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,940
of everything that happened, subsequently.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,330
They always said that they saw not only the worst of humanity,

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,950
but also the best of humanity.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,230
The fact that they were saved.

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,500
They were saved by the people that supported them.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,310
A life affirming experience in the midst of all this horror,

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,420
which is crazy,

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,190
but there was that real balance of extremes that made it

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,950
a really vital background, you know,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,790
and you've got that absolute extremes of horror

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,510
and extremes of somebody who is prepared to risk-

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,890
as my mother always would say,

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,740
not only his life, but the life of this entire family.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,880
I needed a project and I just I said to my Mum:

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,740
Why don't we draw the box?

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,960
Because she'd always talked about the box.

36
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,270
They both always talked about the box.

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,140
And when I was little, I had a very clear idea of the box,

38
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,210
because she would describe it to me, and she would say,

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,790
my me and your father would lie this way,

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,530
and your grandma would lie this way.

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,540
We could only come out at night.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,490
And I had a toy box in my room,

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,910
so in my head, that was this. That was the box.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,230
The lid would open at night.

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,030
And I think there was probably a kids program

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,190
where toys came out of a box at night.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,100
That was my image of the box for many, many years.

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,350
And I was in my 20s, when I went to Amsterdam for the first time,

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,640
went to the Anne Frank House.

50
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,520
Oh, my God, this is what hiding place is like.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,550
How ridiculous. All those years I've been thinking of this box

52
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,870
We started to talk about and I said: Why don't we draw it?

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,880
So I started to do little sketches,

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,040
and she'd look at them and go:  'I don't know'

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,710
You know, it's a piece of paper, it was an object.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,250
So then I started to make little models years in theater.

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,010
So I started sticking things together and balsa wood models,

58
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,540
and I'd bring them to Huddersfield to show her,

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,720
and she'd go 'a bit smaller that way', or 'the bed was a bit higher', 

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,980
and I'd go and remake it.

61
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,770
She still go 'No, I don't know.' And then eventually I said:

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,220
'Well, look, why don't- it's only, you know, it's only six foot square.

63
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,920
Why don't I make a rough layout of it?

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,940
So I got some two by one,

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,740
and I screwed it together into a rough frame,

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,110
and I covered it with paper. I said, come and have a look.

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,750
She walked into this space, and she looked at it and said:

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,460
'Oh, the door's on the wrong side.'

69
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,690
You've seen 25 drawings and five models.

70
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,580
How come you're only just realizing?

71
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,920
It was real learning moment of

72
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,440
actuallythe real thing is completely different.

73
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,370
And although I can work in drawings and I can think in models,

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,940
not everyone can. So I built the real thing to scale.

75
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,580
I showed it as my end of year piece.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,400
And she came to the opening, and she said: It's very good.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,190
She said, 'but still a little bit t oo big',

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,930
because my head, you know, you just, you go,

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,390
it must have been. And then she said, Five foot, five,

80
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,600
took six inches off it. Rebuilt it, installed it in the museum,

81
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,270
and she came and looked at it, and she said: Now it's perfect.

82
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,380
I remembered the 'Night of the Ghetto'

83
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,730
the book that my dad had written.

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,350
And went back to that and thought

85
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,780
 What did he write about the hiding place?

86
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,950
And how it was situated?

87
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,470
And so I went and read his description,

88
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,050
astonished to find that his dimensions were different.

89
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,640
They were smaller still.

90
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,860
So that was sort of the start of it

91
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,070
was that notion that memory was not fixed.

92
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,420
So I then built his version of the box,

93
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,950
her version of the box,

94
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,260
and my imagined version of the box

95
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,590
For her the most difficult thing

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,600
and the thing that she never really dealt with, actually, I think

97
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,700
the one thing that was profoundly difficult was her father's death.

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,780
When they came out of the ghetto,

99
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,510
she wasn't sure if she wanted to leave England,

100
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,220
because her little brother- leave for England

101
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,840
because her little brother was in Kaunas

102
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,140
But the one deciding factor was that she said

103
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,200
she would have found it very difficult to stay in Lithuania

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,990
and to walk down the streets and to never know

105
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,700
if the man she was passing was the man

106
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,290
that had beaten her father to death.

107
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,580
He was arrested the day after the German invasion,

108
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,230
and he was beaten to death, along with 50 to 60 other Jews

109
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,900
 by Lithuanians with clubs in the yard of a garage

110
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,400
on the Wednesday two days later.

111
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,580
And she didn't find out about it till after the war,

112
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,370
and then in the 50s, a German newspaper published photographs

113
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,090
of the event, because there'd been Wehrmacht officers present

114
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,410
who had taken photographs,

115
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,990
and these photographs were printed in a German newspaper.

116
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,880
And she got copies of those photographs,

117
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,230
and she put them in the back of the family album.

118
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,580
She was obsessed by photographs.

119
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,920
She had albums upon albums of photographs,

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,350
and in one of those albums, on the back two pages

121
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,370
were these two photographs of groups of men

122
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,660
having been clubbed to death

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,140
and the man standing over them still with the clubs.

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,510
And they were in our family albums.

125
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,770
I'd always known they were there,

126
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,050
so I grew up seeing them in the back of the albums.

127
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,080
When I was doing history at school,

128
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
we were asked to bring in something from home about the war.

129
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,090
So I snuck into my mum's bedroom and I took

130
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,130
from the back of the photo album these two photographs 

131
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,250
without telling her. And the reason I didn't tell her was not

132
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,470
for a moment that I thought she would mind me taking them.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,960
It was because I was terrified that I knew be in such trouble

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,230
that I had left it till the morning of the lesson to do my homework,

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,350
so I didn't dare tell her, and if I'd asked her,

136
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,800
maybe we would have had a discussion about how to navigate it. 

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,410
But we didn't. I just grabbed them and went to school.

138
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,060
And because I'd seen them all my life,

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
and because I'd known this story all my life,

140
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,570
I had no idea the impact of it.

141
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,760
And everybody else had brought in, you know,

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,320
I think somebody might have brought in a medal,

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,270
and somebody might have brought in a box of matches,

144
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,830
and I brought in a couple of photographs

145
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,330
of my grandfather being clubbed to death,

146
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,240
which was quite a, quite an extraordinary thing to do on reflection.

147
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,750
But I did it very casually, and I think my history teacher loved me.

148
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,850
I think it was the best history lesson she ever gave,

149
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,340
and she didn't have to do anything.

150
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,640
How do you tell stories that are accessible and engaging

151
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,140
about something that's so terrible?

152
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,070
I was born on the 28th of October,

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,570
which is the anniversary of what was called

154
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,580
the big action in the Kaunas ghetto.

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,910
The ghetto was closed at the end of August,

156
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,160
and on the 28th of October,

157
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,180
a decree was issued well prior to the 28th of October,

158
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,430
that all the inhabitants of the ghetto that

159
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,740
at that time were just short of 30,000

160
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,940
should gather in the square of the Democrats at 6am.

161
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,220
Anyone remaining in their houses was going to be killed.

162
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,770
Going to be killed, so that everyone had to go.

163
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,140
And the ghetto was divided into two.

164
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,730
People were sent to the left or to the right,

165
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,960
and those sent to the left were murdered that that next day,

166
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,180
and that was just short of 10,000

167
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,980
So this was such a huge event in everyone's experience at the ghetto.

168
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,350
You speak to any survivor of the Kaunas ghetto,

169
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,280
and they will talk in almost the same language about that day. 

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,270
It's extraordinary.

171
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,830
So for my mum, it was really important that I was born on that day.

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,770
Because it meant that something good happened on a day

173
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,150
that something so terrible had happened.

174
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,860
For me, that's, that's one of the most important things

175
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,500
about that heritage that I have

176
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,570
is that sense of how close that line is,

177
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
between survival and death,

178
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,340
between success and fate.

179
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,060
You know, all those lines, how thin lines are generally.

180
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,100
And I think that's something that

181
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,340
I feel privileged to have grown up with,

182
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,270
because it makes life more when death is so close.

183
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,160
You know, I don't just want to share the horrors of this story.

184
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,700
I want to share what my parents took from it, which is

185
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,470
how it can feed us,

186
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,390
and how we can gain and grow

187
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,360
and take something from them,

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,660
It's vital, because we're going to stop horrible things happening,

189
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,180
but we might be able to learn how to navigate them.
