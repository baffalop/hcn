1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,100
And as walked,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,430
oh we walked probably a mile or so

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,320
we passed on our right hand side

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,780
these huge big camps

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,290
and they were surrounded by barbed wire.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,710
But real big, efficient wires.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,900
And between the two wires,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,180
there was a huge, big ditch.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,730
And the outside wire was electrified.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,080
And there was a constant humming from it.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,450
That power was so strong,

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,730
that you could smell it.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,720
It had a scorching smell

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,530
and every so often,

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,290
there were lookout towers where an SS was standing

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,770
with guards, with a machine gun.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,680
Just in case somebody goes to the wire,

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,470
because if you went near that wire,

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,090
half a yard

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,010
you were just sucked in

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,680
- you were electrocuted.

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,100
Each of these sort of 'better' groups were sort of

23
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,590
identifiable in one way or another.

24
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,160
There was a gypsy camp

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,080
and a Czech camp and so on.

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,770
Dogs in between and watch towers

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,570
with machine guns trained on us

28
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,780
so there wasn't really any escape from there.

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,900
If the guard (?) didn't get you, the dogs did,

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,060
if the dogs didn't - then the watch tower.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,390
A number of people had, so to say, escaped.

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
They walked straight into the electric barbed wire.

33
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,140
It was an escape

34
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,370
- of suicide.

35
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,180
And some people had done that.

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,840
And a horrible smell was all over the camp

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,130
- terrible.

38
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,870
The time I spent in Ausschwitz and Birkenau

39
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,510
That was there, continuously,

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,070
24 hours a day.

41
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,360
The other people, around 150 of them,stood outside.

42
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,860
The two SS men still stood in front of the gate.

43
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,620
And as I walked in the church I- my thoughts were:

44
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,550
Elderly people, children, and so on.

45
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,150
The omen was not very good,

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,640
because I've seen what Germans do with people like that.

47
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,030
And then I thought to myself, whatever happens

48
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,030
to my mother and brother and sister, I'm with a family.

49
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,550
And it was very traumatic for me

50
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,180
Because I didn't want to be parted from

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,540
my mother and my brothers and sisters

52
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,450
And then we were marched off

53
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,770
and that's the last time I'd see-

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,020
my mother and brothers and sister.

55
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,330
They decided to liquidate the Ghetto.

56
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,170
They told us to assemble in the square

57
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,260
and they marched us to the church.

58
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,120
It was a fairly small church and they pushed in

59
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,620
4000 people at that church, without water,

60
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,790
without any food, without any toilet facilities.

61
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,960
Imagine 4000 People in a place

62
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,000
without any toilet facilities.

63
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,120
They told us to come out from the church

64
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,150
and there were two SS officers

65
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,960
And they look you over and asked you your profession.

66
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,750
I told them I was a tailor.

67
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,330
I couldn't thread a needle,

68
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,170
but I thought: You know, if I can do something,

69
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,920
They'll take me.

70
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,580
They told me to go with my mother,

71
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,090
and our family, back into the church.

72
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,000
Anyway, it was a very hot day,

73
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,580
I wanted to go for some water, to the gate.

74
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,500
And when I did, the SS men shouted at me, the officer:

75
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,940
'What's your profession?'

76
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,980
I told him, I was a tailor, once again, a tailor.

77
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,400
He told me to run now, join the 150 people.

78
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,500
And we were taken to Lodz Ghetto.

79
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,920
And all the 3000 - how many? - were taking to Chelmno.

80
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,610
And they were gassed.

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,540
And then burried in mass graves.
